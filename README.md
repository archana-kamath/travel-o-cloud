## Project Introduction

Travel-O-Cloud is an one stop application targeted to help users plan a trip or help others to plan a trip by securely login to the application using AWS Login or by using social login providers like Google or Facebook. Users will be able to check weather in a location or book a hotel there using a Chatbot. Users will be able to upload the pictures once they visited any place and store it using our application, share the pictures on facebook and retreive the pictures from their trip in future using highlights of these locations.
